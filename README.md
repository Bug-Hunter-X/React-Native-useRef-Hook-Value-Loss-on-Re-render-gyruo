# React Native useRef Hook Value Loss on Re-render

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native involving the `useRef` hook.  The issue arises when the ref's value is unexpectedly lost due to component re-renders, even when using `useEffect` with an empty dependency array.

The problem is explained in detail, and a solution is provided.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected implementation.

## Problem
The `useRef` hook in React, while intended for persisting values across renders, can behave unexpectedly if not handled correctly.  In the given example, the ref is recreated on every render cycle, causing the `current` property to reset.  This often occurs when the component itself re-renders due to changes in props or state, even if the ref itself isn't directly dependent on those changes.

## Solution
The solution involves understanding that the `useRef` hook's value is *not* automatically preserved during functional component re-renders; it only provides a persistent object that persists between renders.  The correct approach involves using a callback function with `useEffect` to manage any side effects related to the ref only *after* the component has fully mounted.
