The solution is to ensure that any actions relying on `inputRef.current` are performed within an `useEffect` hook with the empty dependency array `[]` but only *after* the component has mounted. Here's the corrected version:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const focusInput = () => {
      if (inputRef.current) {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      }
    };
    focusInput();
  }, []);

  return (
    <TextInput ref={inputRef} />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

By encapsulating the `focus()` call inside the effect and ensuring the ref is checked for existence, we avoid the error.  The empty dependency array ensures this effect only runs once after the component mounts.
